# Healthcare Data SQL Analysis Project

This project uses SQL to analyze a healthcare dataset, providing insights into patient demographics, medical conditions, and hospital statistics. Key areas of analysis include:

1. Patient Demographics: Retrieve patient details, calculate average age, and analyze gender and blood group distribution.
2. Medical Condition Insights: Identify common medical conditions, patients with multiple conditions, and condition-specific details such as those for older patients or specific demographics.
3. Financial Metrics: Calculate total revenue generated and identify patients with high medical bills.
4. Doctor and Hospital Statistics: List doctor names, identify those with specific patient groups, and analyze hospital admission details.

This project highlights SQLâ€™s use in healthcare analytics by answering questions relevant to patient data, hospital performance, and medical conditions.
